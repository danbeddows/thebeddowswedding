          <Question>Is the ceremony indoors or outdoors?</Question>
          <Answer>
            We're hoping for an outdoor ceremony, and we have some lawn games
            planned - so consider your footwear on grass. This is weather
            dependant, and it may be worth bringing a jacket if it's a cooler
            day.
